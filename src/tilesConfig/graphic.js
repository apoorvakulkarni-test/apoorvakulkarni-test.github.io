I adopted a user-centered approach to design graphics while making sure I maintained brand consistency. Though I can’t show you much of my designs, below is just one of the many I’ve created. I can say that my experience at UConn Football allowed me to receive valuable feedback, how to design for people from high school teenagers to renowned persons of the football community, allowed me to work in design sprints, gave me the space to appreciate making mistakes, pushed me to design at scale for a large audience, gave me a newfound respect in focusing on the user, and molded me into a more confident designer. I can go on, and on, but if you want to hear more about my time at UConn Football, feel free to contact me!"
