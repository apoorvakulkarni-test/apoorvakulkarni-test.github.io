      text:" I wanted my design to represent the Asian American community at UConn - bold, colorful and unique. Since the culture is so diverse, I tried to include elements that were either similar or specific to a certain region. For instance, the Great Wall of China is one of Asia’s many highlights; I added a twist to it by transforming the wall into a dragon’s head. The bottom right features people of Asia’s multicultural community showcasing diversity in religion, ethnicity and gender. In the colored sample, I decided to use gold and red since those colors represent prosperity and good fortune in the majority of Asian culture. Additionally, the waves and bridge represent the long distances the families of Asians and Asian Americans travelled in order to live a better life in America and the sacrifices they made to achieve the “American dream”. Personally, AsACC is a blend of various cultures who accept and respect one another. This center is a home away from home and has given me the opportunities to meet similar people and form long lasting friendships. It is extremely inclusive and diverse and that is primarily what I wanted my design to depict."

Students from all of the cultural centers colored segments from the mural. The numbers on each piece of the mural corresponds to a matching Crayola marker hex value. The above colored version was used as a reference for students to color in. The uncolored elements allowed students to color as they would like."
