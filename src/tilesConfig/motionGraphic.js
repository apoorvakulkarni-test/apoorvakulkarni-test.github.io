Using kinetic typography and animation, I created this motion graphic with Adobe Illustrator and After Effects. I wanted to express my passion through color, life and energy. That is why I opted for a vibrant color palette and fast-paced animation. Chicken noodle soup has unique adaptations all around the world, mainly in southeast asia. My message of this video is to share my love and educate people about the dish and its global presence.",
